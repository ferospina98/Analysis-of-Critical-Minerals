# Analysis-of-Critical-Minerals
This project analyzes critical mineral demand, supply risks, and geopolitical dependencies using data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 

Analysis of Critical Minerals Demand, Supply Risks, and Geopolitical Dependencies

## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical trends and future projections of critical mineral production, trade flows, and demand growth. It explores supply risks, price volatility, and geopolitical dependencies to provide strategic insights for policymakers, industries, and investors.

## Research Questions:
The analysis is guided by the following key questions:
- Which countries are most reliant on critical mineral imports?
- Which minerals face the highest supply risks based on import reliance and country diversity?
- Which minerals have the highest price volatility, and how does it impact supply chain stability?
- How can we measure trade dependency and geopolitical risks in the supply chain?
- What strategies can help mitigate risks and ensure stable access to critical minerals?

## Data Sources
All data for this project was collected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS):
- Mineral Commodity Summaries
- USGS datasets on mineral production, trade flows, and price trends

## Methodology

### Step 1: Supply Risk Index Calculation
- Import reliance percentage from mineral trade data
- Number of import sources (less diversity = higher risk)
- Geopolitical risks based on country dependency

### Step 2: Trade Dependency Analysis
- Identification of key supplier countries

### Step 3: Price Volatility Analysis
- Computation of volatility scores using standard deviation of price growth rates
- Estimation of missing volatility values using economic indicators

### Step 4: Criticality Matrix
- Visualization of supply risk vs. price volatility
- Identification of the most critical minerals

## Key Findings

High-risk minerals: Antimony, Cobalt, Lithium, and Manganese face both high supply risks and price volatility.

Geopolitical dependencies: China dominates the supply chain for multiple critical minerals, increasing potential trade vulnerabilities.

Economic volatility correlations: Countries with unstable mining output or policy restrictions show higher supply risk.
